        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am 22 years old. I grew up in Draper, Utah as the eldest of 5 and attended Corner Canyon High School. I worked <em>really</em> hard in school in the hopes that I would get into BYU. I was elated to accomplish getting accepted into BYU!</p>
        <p>Since highschool, I've attended multiple universities and I've learned a lot about myself over the years. Here is what I've been up to for the last 4 years:
            <ol>
                <li>I attended one year at BYU.</li>
                <li>I spent a year at USU in Logan.</li>
                <li>I lived in Alcala de Henares, Spain for a 3 month study aborad studying spanish and spanish culture.</li>
                <li>Finally decided in my career direction, I began to study digital marketing at UVU and have spent the last two years doing just that.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Discovering my Career Pathway</h2>
            <p>I began my journey interested in psychology, but realized that I was more interested in reading about psychology than having a career in that line of work. <strong>I eventually decided to combine my love for psychology and buisness and found myself in digital marketing.</strong> After attending UVU for about 2 semesters, I applied to work at <a href="https://greenhouseuvu.com/" target="_blank">Green House Sales and Marketing</a>. Green House has given me so much opportunity and growth. I find myself excited to go to work because I know I will leave knowing that I learned something new that day. I like to say that I attend UVU for Green House, not the classes.</p>
        <p>This last August 2024, I got married to my best friend in the Draper Utah Temple. Immediately following my honeymoon, I was promoted to both <a href="workhistory.html#projectmanager">Project Manager</a> and Hiring and Onboarding Specialist. Now I am finishing my last year of college, set to graduate in May 2025, and I am excited for what the future holds.</p>
