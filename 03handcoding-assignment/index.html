        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am 22 years old and the eldest of 5 children in my family. I grew up in Draper, Utah and attended Corner Canyon High School. I was that kid who didn't want to be noticed. I worked <em>really</em> hard in school in the hopes that I would get into BYU. I will never forget the way I felt the day I opened my letter of acceptance into BYU.</p>
        <p>Since highschool, I've attended multiple colleges and learned a lot about myself in the process.
            <ol>
                <li>One year at BYU</li>
                <li>One year at USU</li>
                <li>3 months in Alcala de Henares in Spain for a study aborad learning spanish</li>
                <li>Two years at UVU</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I began my journey interested in psychology, but realized that I was more interested in reading about psychology than having a career in that line of work. <strong>I eventually decided to combine my love for psychology and buisness and found myself in digital marketing.</strong> After attending UVU for about 2 semesters, I applied to work at <a href="https://greenhouseuvu.com/" target="_blank">Green House Sales and Marketing</a>. Green House has given me so much opportunity and growth. I find myself excited to go to work because I know I will leave knowing that I learned something new that day. I like to say that I attend UVU for Green House, not the classes.</p>
        <p>This last August 2024, I got married to my best friend in the Draper Utah Temple. Immediately following my honeymoon, I was promoted to both <a href="workhistory.html#projectmanager">Project Manager</a> and Hiring and Onboarding Specialist. Now I am finishing my last year of college, set to graduate in May 2025, and I am excited for what the future holds.</p>
